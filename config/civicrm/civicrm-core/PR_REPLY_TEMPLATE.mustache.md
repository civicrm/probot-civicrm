Thank you for contributing to CiviCRM!

A series of tests will automatically run to help review the change. For new contributors, we will have to wait for an admin to trigger the build.

Once [the tests](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/testing/) have run, it will require a review from someone else. Anyone can review a PR and it definitely helps speed up the process. Then a merger will do its own review and/or rely on the review that was done already. It's a difficult process that can be frustrating when a lot of effort was invested already, but it's necessary to ensure the stability of the project. People reviewing and merging changes are volunteers or people doing it as part of their work to improve the project, so they work on what they find most relevant to their priorities. One way to help speed things up, is to help with the review of other PRs.
